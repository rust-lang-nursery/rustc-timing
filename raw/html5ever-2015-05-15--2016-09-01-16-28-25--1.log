    Auto merge of #34494 - CensoredUsername:allow_sysV64_abi, r=nagisa
    
    Allow specification of the system V AMD64 ABI constraint.
    
    This can be specified using `extern "sysV64" fn` on all platforms.
    
    This ABI is used as the C ABI on unix platforms, but can only be specified there using extern "C". It was impossible to specify on other platforms. Meanwhile the win64 ABI, which was the extern "C" ABI on the windows platform could be specified on other platforms using extern "win64".
    
    This pull request adds the the "sysV64" ABI constraint which exposes this calling convention on platforms where it is not the C ABI.
