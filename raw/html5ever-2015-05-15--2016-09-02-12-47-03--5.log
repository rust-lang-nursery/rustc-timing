    Auto merge of #36024 - japaric:mips64, r=alexcrichton
    
    add mips64-gnu and mips64el-gnu targets
    
    With this commit one can build no_core (and probably no_std as well)
    Rust programs for these targets. It's not yet possible to cross compile
    std for these targets because rust-lang/libc doesn't know about the
    mips64 architecture.
    
    These targets have been tested by cross compiling the "smallest hello"
    program (see code below) and then running it under QEMU.
    
    ``` rust
    
    extern {
        fn puts(_: *const u8);
    }
    
    fn start(_: isize, _: *const *const u8) -> isize {
        unsafe {
            let msg = b"Hello, world!\0";
            puts(msg as *const _ as *const u8);
        }
        0
    }
    
    trait Copy {}
    
    trait Sized {}
    ```

    The cabi stuff is likely wrong. I just copied cabi_mips source and changed some `4`s to `8`s and `32`s to `64`s. It was enough to get libc's `puts` to work but I'd like someone familiar with this module to check it.
