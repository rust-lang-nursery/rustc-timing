    Split the type context into a global and a local (inference-only) one.
    
    After this change, each `InferCtxt` creates its own local type interner for types with inference by-products.
    Most of the code which handles both a global and a local interner uses `'gcx` and `'tcx` for them.
    A reference to the type context in that situation (e.g. `infcx.tcx`) is `TyCtxt<'a, 'gcx, 'tcx>`.
    The global type context which used to be `&'a TyCtxt<'tcx>` is now `TyCtxt<'a, 'tcx, 'tcx>`.
    
    In order to minimize the number of extra lifetime parameters, many functions became methods.
    Where possible (some inherent impls), lifetime parameters were added on the impl, not each method.
    
    As inference by-products no longer escape their inference contexts, memory usage is lower.
    Example of `-Z time-passes` excerpt for `librustc`, stage1 (~100MB gains):

    **NOTE**: Functions changed to methods weren't re-indented to keep this PR easier to review.
    Once approved, the changes will be mechanically performed.
    However, indentation changes of function arguments are there - and I believe there's a way to hide whitespace-only changes in diffs on GitHub.
