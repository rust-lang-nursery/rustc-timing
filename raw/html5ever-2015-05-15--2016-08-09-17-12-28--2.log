    Auto merge of #35166 - nikomatsakis:incr-comp-ice-34991-2, r=mw
    
    Address ICEs running w/ incremental compilation and building glium
    
    Fixes for various ICEs I encountered trying to build glium with incremental compilation enabled. Building glium now works. Of the 4 ICEs, I have test cases for 3 of them -- I didn't isolate a test for the last commit and kind of want to go do other things -- most notably, figuring out why incremental isn't saving much *effort*.
    
    But if it seems worthwhile and I can come back and try to narrow down the problem.
