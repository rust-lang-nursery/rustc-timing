    Auto merge of #31824 - jseyfried:privacy_in_resolve, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This PR privacy checks paths as they are resolved instead of in `librustc_privacy` (fixes #12334 and fixes #31779). This removes the need for the `LastPrivate` system introduced in PR #9735, the limitations of which cause #31779.
    
    This PR also reports privacy violations in paths to intra- and inter-crate items the same way -- it always reports the first inaccessible segment of the path.
    
    Since it fixes #31779, this is a [breaking-change]. For example, the following code would break:
    ```rust
    mod foo {
        pub use foo::bar::S;
        mod bar { // `bar` should be private to `foo`
            pub struct S;
        }
    }
    
    impl foo::S {
        fn f() {}
    }
    
    fn main() {
        foo::bar::S::f(); // This is now a privacy error
    }
    ```
