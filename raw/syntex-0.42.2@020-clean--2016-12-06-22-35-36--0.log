    Auto merge of #38134 - bluss:iter-nth, r=aturon
    
    Remove Self: Sized from Iterator::nth
    
    It is an unnecessary restriction; nth neither needs self to be sized
    nor needs to be exempted from the trait object.
    
    It increases the utility of the nth method, because type specific
    implementations are available through `&mut I` or through an iterator
    trait object.
    
    It is a backwards compatible change due to the special cases of the
    `where Self: Sized` bound; it was already optional to include this bound
    in `Iterator` implementations.
