    evaluate obligations in LIFO order during closure projection
    
    This is an annoying gotcha with the projection cache's handling of
    nested obligations.
    
    Nested projection obligations enter the issue in this case:
    ```
    DEBUG:rustc::traits::project: AssociatedTypeNormalizer: depth=3
    normalized
    <std::iter::Map<std::ops::Range<i32>,
    [closure@not-a-recursion-error.rs:5:30: 5:53]> as
    std::iter::IntoIterator>::Item to _#7t with 12 add'l obligations
    ```
    
    Here the normalization result is the result of the nested impl
    `<[closure@not-a-recursion-error.rs:5:30: 5:53] as FnMut(i32)>::Output`,
    which is an additional obligation that is a part of "add'l obligations".
    
    By itself, this is proper behaviour - the additional obligation is
    returned, and the RFC 447 rules ensure that it is processed before the
    output `#_7t` is used in any way.
    
    However, the projection cache breaks this - it caches the
    `<std::iter::Map<std::ops::Range<i32>,[closure@not-a-recursion-error.rs:5:30:
    5:53]> as std::iter::IntoIterator>::Item = #_7t` resolution. Now
    everybody else that attempts to look up the projection will just get
    `#_7t` *without* any additional obligations. This obviously causes all
    sorts of trouble (here a spurious `EvaluatedToAmbig` results in
    specializations not being discarded
    [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9ca50bd4d50b55456e88a8c3ad8fcc9798f57522/src/librustc/traits/select.rs#L1705)).
    
    The compiler works even with this projection cache gotcha because in most
    cases during "one-pass evaluation". we tend to process obligations in LIFO
    order - after an obligation is added to the cache, we process its nested
    obligations before we do anything else (and if we have a cycle, we handle
    it specifically) - which makes sure the inference variables are resolved
    before they are used.
    
    That "LIFO" order That was not done when projecting out of a closure, so
    let's just fix that for the time being.
    
    Fixes #38033.
    
    Beta-nominating because regression.
