    Do not resolve inherent static methods from other crates prematurely
    
    Under some specific circumstances paths like `Type::method` can be resolved early in rustc_resolve instead of type checker. `Type` must be defined in another crate, it should be an enum or a trait object (i.e. a type that acts as a "module" in resolve), and `method` should be an inherent static method.
    As a result, such paths don't go through `resolve_ufcs`, may be resolved incorrectly and break some invariants in type checker. This patch removes special treatment of such methods.
    
    The removed code was introduced in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/2bd46e767c0fe5b6188df61cb9daf8f2e65a3ed0 to fix a problem that no longer exists.
