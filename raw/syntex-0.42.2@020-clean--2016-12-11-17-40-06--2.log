    Reinstate while loop in deaggregator pass
    
    A previous commit must have removed the `while let` loop here by
    mistake; for each basic block, it should find and deaggregate multiple
    statements in their index order, and the `curr` index tracks the
    progress through the block.
    
    This fixes both the case of deaggregating statements in separate
    basic blocks (preserving `curr` could prevent that) as well
    as multiple times in the same block (missing loop prevented that).
    
    The loop was lost in commit bda46c21fe30377b9587b584c64ffe99da6c14ce.
