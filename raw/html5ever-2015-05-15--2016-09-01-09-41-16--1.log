    Auto merge of #35755 - SimonSapin:char_convert, r=alexcrichton
    
    Implement std::convert traits for char
    
    This is motivated by avoiding the `as` operator, which sometimes silently truncates, and instead use conversions that are explicitly lossless and infallible.
    
    I’m less certain that `From<u8> for char` should be implemented: while it matches an existing behavior of `as`, it’s not necessarily the right thing to use for non-ASCII bytes. It effectively decodes bytes as ISO/IEC 8859-1 (since Unicode designed its first 256 code points to be compatible with that encoding), but that is not apparent in the API name.
