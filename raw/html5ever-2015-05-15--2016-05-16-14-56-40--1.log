    Auto merge of #33500 - Nercury:update-aarch64-android-target-to-match-abi, r=alexcrichton
    
    Update aarch64-linux-android target to match android abi.
    
    - Changed `target_env` to "gnu" to empty "" for all android targets because it does not matter for android.
    - The PR #33048 added "max_atomic_width" for arm-android but missed recently added armv7-android. Add it there too.
    - Added features `+neon,+fp-armv8` because they [must exist on `aarch64` android](http://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpu-features.html).
    - Update libc to include https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/pull/282 so that rust's std lib works on android's aarch64 (the main issue there was incorrect structure alignment on 64-bit arm).
