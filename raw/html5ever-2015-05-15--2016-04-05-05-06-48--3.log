    resolve: Improve import failure detection and lay groundwork for RFC 1422
    
    This PR improves import failure detection and lays some groundwork for RFC 1422.
    More specifically, it
     - Avoids recomputing the resolution of an import directive's module path.
     - Refactors code in `resolve_imports` that does not scale to the arbitrarily many levels of visibility that will be required by RFC 1422.
      - Replaces `ModuleS`'s fields `public_glob_count`, `private_glob_count`, and `resolved_globs` with a list of glob import directives `globs`.
      - Replaces `NameResolution`'s fields `pub_outstanding_references` and `outstanding_references` with a field `single_imports` of a newly defined type `SingleImports`.
     - Improves import failure detection by detecting cycles that include single imports (currently, only cycles of globs are detected). This fixes #32119.
