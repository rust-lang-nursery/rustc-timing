    memrchr: Correct aligned offset computation
    
    The memrchr fallback did not compute the offset correctly. It was
    intentioned to land on usize-aligned addresses but did not.
    This was suspected to have resulted in a crash on ARMv7!
    
    This bug affected non-linux platforms.
    
    I think like this, if we have a slice with pointer `ptr` and length
    `len`, we want to find the last usize-aligned offset in the slice.
    The correct computation should be:
    
    For example if ptr = 1 and len = 6, and `size_of::<usize>()` is 4:
    
    ```
    [ x x x x x x ]
      1 2 3 4 5 6
            ^-- last aligned address at offset 3 from the start.
    ```
    
    The last aligned address is ptr + len - (ptr + len) % usize_size.
    
    Compute offset from the start as:
    
    offset = len - (ptr + len) % usize_size = 6 - (1 + 6) % 4 = 6 - 3 = 3.
    
    I believe the function's return value was always correct previously, if
    the platform supported unaligned addresses.
    
    Fixes #35967
