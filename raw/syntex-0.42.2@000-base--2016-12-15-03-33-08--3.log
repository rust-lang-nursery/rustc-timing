    Auto merge of #37702 - redox-os:redox, r=brson
    
    Redox Support Preview
    
    # Important - This is only a preview of a working `sys::redox`.
    
    Compiling the Redox default distribution with this `libstd` results in a fully functioning distribution. As such, all further changes would be cosmetic or implementing features that have not been used by the default distribution (of which there are only a small number).
    
    I do not expect this to be merged, but would like to discuss how it may be improved and get feedback.
    
    There are a few `unimplemented!()` - `cloexec` for example. I have documented them below. These would be resolved before desiring a merge.
    
    There are also issues with how the Redox syscall library is called - currently I am using a re-export in `libc` but that probably would not be desired.
