    Remove `ErasedRegions` from substs
    
    This commit removes the `ErasedRegions` enum from `Substs`. Instead, in trans, we just generate a vector of `ReStatic` of suitable length. The goal is both general cleanup and to help pave the way for a glorious future where erasure is used in type check.

    One concern: might be nice to do some profiling. Not sure the best way to do that. Perhaps I'll investigate running nrc's test suite locally.
