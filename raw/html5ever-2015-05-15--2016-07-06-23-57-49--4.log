    Fix expansion performance regression
    
    **syntax-[breaking-change] cc #31645**
    
    This fixes #34630 by reverting commit 5bf7970 of PR #33943, which landed in #34424.
    
    By removing the `Rc<_>` wrapping around `Delimited` and `SequenceRepetition` in `TokenTree`, 5bf7970 made cloning `TokenTree`s more expensive. While this had no measurable performance impact on the compiler's crates, it caused an order of magnitude performance regression on some macro-heavy code in the wild. I believe this is due to clones of `TokenTree`s in `macro_parser.rs` and/or `macro_rules.rs`.
