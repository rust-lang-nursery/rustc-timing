    Auto merge of #38191 - oli-obk:clippy_is_sad, r=eddyb
    
    annotate stricter lifetimes on LateLintPass methods to allow them to forward to a Visitor
    
    this unblocks clippy (rustup blocked after #37918)
    
    clippy has lots of lints that internally call an `intravisit::Visitor`, but the current lifetimes on `LateLintPass` methods conflicted with the required lifetimes (there was no connection between the HIR elements and the `TyCtxt`)
