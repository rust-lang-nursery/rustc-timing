    [LLVM 4.0] Don't assume llvm::StringRef is null terminated
    
    StringRefs have a length and their contents are not usually null-terminated. The solution is to either copy the string data (in `rustc_llvm::diagnostic`) or take the size into account (in LLVMRustPrintPasses).
    
    I couldn't trigger a bug caused by this (apparently all the strings returned in practice are actually null-terminated) but this is more correct and more future-proof.
