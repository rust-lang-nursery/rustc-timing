    Auto merge of #31746 - erickt:newline, r=sfackler
    
    syntax: Always pretty print a newline after doc comments
    
    Before this patch, code that had a doc comment as the first
    line, as in:
    
    ```rust
    /// Foo
    struct Foo;
    ```
    
    Was pretty printed into:
    
    ```rust
    ///Foostruct Foo;
    ```
    
    This makes sure that that there is always a trailing newline
    after a doc comment.
    
    Closes #31722
