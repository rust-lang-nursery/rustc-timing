    Auto merge of #39062 - martinhath:placement-in-binaryheap, r=nagisa
    
    Implement placement-in protocol for `BinaryHeap`
    
    Related to #30172, and loosley based on #38551.
    
    At the moment, this PR is in a pretty rough state, but I wanted to get some feedback to see if I'm going in the right direction.
    
    I hope the Mentor label of #30172 is still applicable, even though it's a year old 😄
