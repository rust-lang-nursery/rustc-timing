    Auto merge of #33787 - cuviper:local-rebuild, r=alexcrichton
    
    Add --enable-local-rebuild to bootstrap from the current release
    
    In Linux distributions, it is often necessary to rebuild packages for cases like applying new patches or linking against new system libraries.  In this scenario, the rustc in the distro build environment may already match the current release that we're trying to rebuild.  Thus we don't want to use the prior release's bootstrap key, nor `--cfg stage0` for the prior unstable features.
    
    The new `configure --enable-local-rebuild` option specifies that we are rebuilding from the current release.  The current bootstrap key is used for the local rustc, and current stage1 features are also assumed.  Both the makefiles and rustbuild support this configuration.
    
    Fixes #29556
