    Fix travis builds
    
    After reading some articles [1] [2] yesterday about Docker and the "init"
    process I got to thinking about the problems that we've been seeing on Travis.
    The basic problem is that a Linux system may need an "init" process to work
    properly when processes become zombies. Docker by default doesn't handle this
    and the root process typically isn't an init process, so this can occasionally
    cause quite a few problems.
    
    We've been seeing spurious errors on Travis inside containers which look like
    OOM and such, but my guess is that zombie processes were being reparented to the
    top-level shell. The shell didn't expect the zombies and then behaved very
    strangely.
    
    This commit fixes these problems by using Yelp's "dumb-init" program [2] as the
    init process in all of our containers. This ensures that there's a valid init
    ready to reap children when they're reparented, which our test suite apparently
    generates a bunch of throughout the tests and such.
